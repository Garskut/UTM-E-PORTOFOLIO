									<h3>INDUSTRIAL TALK 1: OVERVIEW OF ICT JOBS IN CLARITY TECHWORKS</h3>
									<a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAF6zSYQGwo/Z36NT8wPj7C7vmT6Dmt_gg/edit?utm_content=DAF6zSYQGwo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">Poster Link</a>
									<p>Reflection : <br />
									<p>In the industry talk, I discovered the diverse roles at Clarity Techworks, a company specializing in cryptocurrency and digital assets. Ms. Liyana ensures product perfection through testing, Mr. Saiful brings creativity to web/API development, Ms. Izzah Fatini excels in languages and frameworks, Ms. Adilatul enhances user experiences with design, and Mr. Ridwan oversees Android app development. The key lesson emphasized the importance of teamwork, collaboration, and communication in achieving success in any project or field. The talk highlighted the significance of building connections, maintaining a positive mindset, and having self-confidence for professional growth.</p>

									<h3>Virtual Talk and class visit at UTM Digital. “UTMDigital – Our Digital University Driver” </h3>
									<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b1AOXlodejqZw1LEypilv7YbPJhb82tX/view">Our Video</a>
									<p>Reflection : <br />
									<p>During our class visit to UTM Digital, we got a comprehensive look at the hub for all electricity and internet activities serving UTM JB University. UTM Digital plays a vital role, as the entire university relies on it, and when it shuts down, UTM does too. The facility handles everything related to UTM's smart services and portal, including support and ICT services. Inside UTM Digital, we explored workspaces equipped with meeting rooms, a kitchen, and ample air conditioning. We also had the opportunity to tour the Data center, the nerve center hosting servers that power the entire UTM. Despite not being able to record our visit to the Data center, we witnessed firsthand that UTM is the only Malaysian university with a 24/7 monitored and secure Data center. We interviewed Dr. Aruslin Abdullah, an officer at UTM Digital, gaining more insights into how they deliver ICT services, providing an enhanced experience for students and teachers. UTM Digital issues UTM ID exclusively for UTM students and teachers, granting access to UTM portal, UTM wifi, and UTMsmart. Overall, it was an enriching experience to explore an ICT room and Server room for the first time.</p>

									<h3>INDUSTRIAL TALK 2 :  System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary) </h3>
									<a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAF5ZmWIcKk/FOScCL7U2kzotrUelpEoaA/edit">Our Report</a>
									<p>Reflection : <br />
									<p>This industry talk provided a brief yet insightful overview of the role of a Data Analyst. Analytics is a methodical approach to breaking down data into segments to gain valuable insights for informed decision-making. It involves exploring internal and external data sources, refining raw data, and engaging in analytics, modeling, and forecasting future trends. Dr. Qistina shared her life experience during the talk. In 2016, she enrolled in UTM's Information Design program to pursue her interests in data, IoT, and AI. After a challenging 10-month Industrial Training in her fourth year, she became a Social Media Data Analyst at TMONE. Her exceptional work led to her staying in the same role after graduating in 2020. When the project concluded in 2021, she was promoted to a Data Engineer due to her technical skills. Currently, she works in AI operations at Credence as an Analytics Delivery expert. A crucial lesson from her journey, applicable to every student, is the importance of communication, teamwork, and confidence in achieving success in a dynamic workplace.</p>

									<h3>INDUSTRIAL TALK 3 :   Tech-Driven Innovation - Unleashing the Powers of Emerging Technologies for Business Growth in Urban Farming solution (I-Farm) </h3>
									<a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAF6hY69LwU/IdvcN8ShS_JYjDNuTnZuFQ/edit?utm_content=DAF6hY69LwU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">Our report</a>
									<p>Reflection : <br />
									<p>Dr. Seah Choon Sen teaches us that with the advancing technology, it is not confined to just one field; even agriculture plays a role in technological development. With the progression of sophisticated technology, I can observe and visualize the enhancement of the quality of the agricultural sector in the technology industry. It becomes a focal point in agriculture, aiming to enrich the growth quality with abundant mineral resources and ensuring safe consumption.</p>

									<h3>PC ASSEMBLE  </h3>
									<a href="https://github.com/dotrovi/UTM-e-Portfolio/blob/main/PC%20Assemble%20(Lab)/PCAssemble.jpg">Our Photo</a>
									<p>Reflection : <br />
									<p>In the construction of this PC structure, I can see how unique and beneficial a PC is for all humanity. What I admire about a computer is that, to build a machine, there must be a foundation to support the structure and prevent it from collapsing. Similarly, a computer has a foundation built from components like chipsets, motherboards, fans, etc., serving as a reference for human capabilities in handling crucial information in life, especially regarding technology.</p>

									<h3>Design Thinking</h3>
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6It7ssxl84">Our Video</a>
									<p>Reflection : <br />
								
									<p>Design thinking teaches me to come up with new technology ideas in any field. Creating technological solutions can make things easier and save time, especially with user-friendly interfaces. In my design thinking project, I'm working on a screen time limit innovation. The goal is to help users spend more time on meaningful activities instead of getting stuck on social media, which can be addictive. This system aims to manage our urge to keep looking at the screen by setting limits. This way, we can do more useful things and find motivation or stay busy away from the screen. With this system, I see a small but meaningful progress, encouraging people to focus on their life goals instead of wasting even a small percentage of their time.</p>
