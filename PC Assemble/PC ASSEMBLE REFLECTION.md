# PC ASSEMBLE REFLECTION

In the construction of this PC structure, I can see how unique and beneficial a PC is for all humanity. What I admire about a computer is that, to build a machine, there must be a foundation to support the structure and prevent it from collapsing. Similarly, a computer has a foundation built from components like chipsets, motherboards, fans, etc., serving as a reference for human capabilities in handling crucial information in life, especially regarding technology.
