# INDUSTRI TALK 2 REFLECTION

This industry talk provided a brief yet insightful overview of the role of a Data Analyst. Analytics is a methodical approach to breaking down data into segments to gain valuable insights for informed decision-making. It involves exploring internal and external data sources, refining raw data, and engaging in analytics, modeling, and forecasting future trends. Dr. Qistina shared her life experience during the talk. In 2016, she enrolled in UTM's Information Design program to pursue her interests in data, IoT, and AI. After a challenging 10-month Industrial Training in her fourth year, she became a Social Media Data Analyst at TMONE. Her exceptional work led to her staying in the same role after graduating in 2020. When the project concluded in 2021, she was promoted to a Data Engineer due to her technical skills. Currently, she works in AI operations at Credence as an Analytics Delivery expert. A crucial lesson from her journey, applicable to every student, is the importance of communication, teamwork, and confidence in achieving success in a dynamic workplace.
