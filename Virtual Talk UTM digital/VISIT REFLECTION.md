# VIRTUAL TALK WITH UTM DIGITAL AND VISITING UTM DIGITAL

During our class visit to UTM Digital, we got a comprehensive look at the hub for all electricity and internet activities serving UTM JB University. UTM Digital plays a vital role, as the entire university relies on it, and when it shuts down, UTM does too. The facility handles everything related to UTM's smart services and portal, including support and ICT services. Inside UTM Digital, we explored workspaces equipped with meeting rooms, a kitchen, and ample air conditioning. We also had the opportunity to tour the Data center, the nerve center hosting servers that power the entire UTM. Despite not being able to record our visit to the Data center, we witnessed firsthand that UTM is the only Malaysian university with a 24/7 monitored and secure Data center. I ask about UTM Account for misleading network, and the reason that cause me to aware about the 3rd party technology.  UTM Digital issues UTM ID exclusively for UTM students and teachers, granting access to UTM portal, UTM wifi, and UTMsmart. Overall, it was an enriching experience to explore an ICT room and Server room for the first time.
