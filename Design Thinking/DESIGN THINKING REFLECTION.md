# DESIGN THINGKING REFLECTION #

Design thinking teaches me to come up with new technology ideas in any field. Creating technological solutions can make things easier and save time, especially with user-friendly interfaces. In my design thinking project, I'm working on a screen time limit innovation. The goal is to help users spend more time on meaningful activities instead of getting stuck on social media, which can be addictive. This system aims to manage our urge to keep looking at the screen by setting limits. This way, we can do more useful things and find motivation or stay busy away from the screen. With this system, I see a small but meaningful progress, encouraging people to focus on their life goals instead of wasting even a small percentage of their time.
